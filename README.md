## Synopsis

This project is an assembler for MiniSRC archetecture instruction set. It is created for the course ELEC-374 at ECE department, Queen's University at Kingston.

As the course has modified the instruction set in the term 2018W, this project has updated alone with the change. Old assembler can still be found in the past commit 1bbb39c480416c0a8732cb96b538102508a99df6.

Also, the project now uses Gradle for test and build. Old repository commits has been all erased, but the code are preserved.

## Motivation

In the course ELEC-374, students are required to implement and test a MiniSRC processor. For the purpose of testing, students need to write assembly code and manually assemble them into machine code. Such process is tedious and error-prone.

To assist this process, this assembler has been developed. Further customization and extension has been made possible for those who are ambitious and want to seek challenge and bonus marks.

With consideration of the divergence of OS/environment of the students in the department, the assembler has been written in java for portability.

## Installation

Runnable .jar file can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/RichardYan314/minisrc_asm/releases/latest). The latest releases supports the miniSRC ISA, ELEC 374 - 2018W version.

Parser generator code supporting older ELEC 374 - 2017W version of the miniSRC ISA can be found in the commit 1bbb39c480416c0a8732cb96b538102508a99df6. If you are reading this very sentence but are not able to find a release for that, you may build it yourself (see below).

The assembler is compiled with java 1.8.0\_161. However, given the java language features used, any version above 1.7 might also work (untested).

## Mannual Build

You can obtain the source from https://github.com/RichardYan314/minisrc_asm. Gradle is provided for test/build.

## Usage

Assuming assembly code is in `test.s` file under current directory. Run the assembler from command line as follows:

``` bash
java -jar minisrc.jar -i test.s
```

Run the following command for help:

``` bash
java -jar minisrc.jar -h
```

## Tests

Test suit has been prepared with JUnit (4.12, included). You can run it in anyway way as you like. One method provided is to execute the Gradle task `test`

## Contributors

As the assembler now meets the minimal requirement of the course, this project is unlikely to continue. I will occationally check pull request, probablly.

If you want to customize the assembler for your own purpose, please fork this project and do so by all means. But I request should you want to publish it, please clearly indicate your modification no longer suit the requirement for the course ELEC-374 as mentioned above; and also include a reference to the original project (here). I do not want to confuse the students when they search for this assembler on Google (or any other source) and unawaringly get hold on something unsuitable for their purpose.

## About Customization

The assembly syntax is specified in extended Backusï¿½CNaur form (EBNF), which is where the customizability comes from. Currently, the syntax is still pretty much context-free. For example, it does not allow the using of lables, which is very common in other assembly language.

The syntax specification is parsed with [Coco/R](http://ssw.jku.at/Coco/). It allows the use of semantic mechanism, which can further extend the capability of the assembler.
